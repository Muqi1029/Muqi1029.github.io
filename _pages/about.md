Hello :smile: I am Muqi Li, a senior university student majoring in Data Science and Big Data Technology at East China Normal University (ECNU). My life motto is "Everything is Reasonable," and my personal goal and lifelong pursuit is to build an AI system that is:

1. Scalable
2. Robust
3. Trustworthy
4. Efficient

Based on these four core requirements, my research interests include:

- **Parallel and Distributed Computing**: Designing more effective and efficient algorithms to enhance scalability and robustness in computing processes.
- **Uncertainty Qualification**: Making AI systems more trustworthy.
- **Machine Learning Systems**: Developing better serving and training infrastructure, and co-designing hardware and software to contribute to the broader community.

<span style="color: red;">I am actively looking for Machine Learning System Industrial/Research Opportunity.</span>
